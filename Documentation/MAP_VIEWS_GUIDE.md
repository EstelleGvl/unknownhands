# Map Views Guide

## Overview

The map visualization now includes **7 specialized map views** that let you explore different aspects of the Unknown Hands database geographically. Each view shows a different slice of the data, crossing entity types and relationships.

## Using Map Views

### Switching Views

1. Open the **Map** tab
2. At the top, find the **"Map View:"** dropdown
3. Select your desired view
4. The map will rebuild with new data

```
Map View: [Manuscripts - Current Location (Holdings) ‚ñº]
```

### Combining with Features

All map views work with the standard map features:

**‚úÖ Clustering** - Groups nearby markers (recommended for dense areas)  
**‚úÖ Heatmap** - Shows density overlay (great for identifying centers)  
**‚úÖ Time Filter** - Filters by date (where applicable)

**‚úÖ Routes** - Shows movement paths (for manuscripts)

### Connection Lines by View

Connection lines adapt to the selected view:

| View | Connection Type | Color | What it Shows |
|------|----------------|-------|---------------|
| Manuscripts - Production | Production ‚Üí Holding | üü† Orange dashed | Manuscript movement |
| Production Units - All | Monastery ‚Üí PU | üíú Purple dotted | Institutional links |
| Other views | (not applicable) | - | - |

4. Switch to "Manuscripts - Current Location (Holdings)"
5. Compare heatmap - see how manuscripts moved
6. Enable Connection Lines to see individual movements
```

**Question answered:** Where were manuscripts produced vs where they ended up?

---

### Workflow 2: Explore Monastic Networks

```
1. Select "Monastic Institutions"
2. Enable Clustering (many monasteries in dense areas)
3. Note distribution across Europe
4. Switch to "Production Units - By Monastery"
5. See which monasteries had scriptoria
6. Click markers to see specific production units
```

**Question answered:** Which monasteries were centers of book production?

---

### Workflow 3: Map Female Scribal Activity

```
1. Select "Female Scribes - Work Locations"
2. Enable Heatmap to see concentrations
3. Use Time Filter to focus on specific century
4. Click markers to see individual scribes
5. Switch to "All Scribes - Work Locations"
6. Compare patterns (male vs female scribal geography)
```

**Question answered:** Where did female scribes work? How does it compare to overall scribal activity?

---

### Workflow 4: Trace Manuscript Production Chains

```
1. Select "Production Units - All Locations"
2. Enable Connection Lines (shows monastery links)
3. Filter by time period (e.g., 1200-1300)
4. Click on production units to see details
5. Switch to "Manuscripts - Production Location"
6. See the actual manuscripts produced at those locations
```

**Question answered:** What was the production chain from monastery to manuscript?

## Data Notes

### What Gets Mapped

Each view shows **only records with valid coordinates**:

- ‚úÖ **Included:** Records with Latitude/Longitude fields
- ‚ùå **Excluded:** Records without location data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fallback:** Some views use fallback locations (e.g., MS production ‚Üí holding)

### Counting and Grouping

- **Production Units by Monastery:** One marker per monastery, size reflects PU count
- **Scribes - Work Locations:** One marker per unique location-scribe combination
- **All other views:** One marker per record

### Relationships Used

The views leverage multiple relationship types:

1. **Pointer fields:** Direct links (e.g., MS ‚Üí Holding Institution)
2. **Relationship records:** Explicit relationships in relationships.json
3. **Reverse lookups:** Finding what points to a record (e.g., PUs ‚Üí Monastery)

## Color Legend

| Color | Category | Views |
|-------|----------|-------|
| üîµ Blue | Manuscripts | Current Location, Production Location |
| üü† Orange | Production Units | All Locations |
| üíú Purple | Monastic Institutions | Monastic Institutions |
| üî¥ Magenta | Monastery+PUs | By Monastery (grouped) |
| üíö Green | Scribes | Female Scribes, All Scribes |

---

## Performance Tips

### For Best Performance

1. **Enable Clustering** for views with many markers (especially scribes, manuscripts)
2. **Use Time Filter** to reduce marker count
3. **Disable Heatmap** if map becomes sluggish (rare)
4. **Zoom in** before disabling clustering

### Expected Marker Counts

| View | Typical Count | With Clustering |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Manuscripts - Current | 500-1000 | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| Manuscripts - Production | 300-800 | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| Production Units - All | 200-500 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional |
| Production Units - Monastery | 50-150 | ‚ùå Not needed |
| Monastic Institutions | 100-300 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional |
| Female Scribes | 20-100 | ‚ùå Not needed |
| All Scribes | 100-500 | ‚úÖ Recommended |

## Troubleshooting

### "No mappable coordinates for this view"

**Cause:** No records in current view have valid coordinates  
**Solutions:**
- Try a different view
- Check if entity type has location data
- Verify data has been loaded (refresh page)

### Few or no markers for scribes

**Cause:** Scribes need to be linked to manuscripts with locations  
**Solutions:**
- Check relationship records exist
- Verify manuscripts have production/holding locations
- Try "All Scribes" instead of just female

### Markers overlap even with clustering

**Cause:** Many records at exact same coordinates  
**Solutions:**
- Click cluster to expand (spiderfy effect)
- Zoom in further
- Check if data has sufficient coordinate precision

### Connection lines not appearing

**Cause:** Only some views support connection lines  
**Solutions:**
- Use "Manuscripts - Production Location" for MS connections
- Use "Production Units - All Locations" for monastery connections
- Ensure records have both endpoint locations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Color by metadata** - Color scribes by gender, manuscripts by language, etc.
2. **Custom marker icons** - Different shapes for different entity types
3. **Animated timeline** - Watch geography change over centuries
4. **Export view** - Save current map as image or coordinates as CSV
5. **Split view** - Compare two map views side-by-side

### Potential New Views

- **Texts - Geographic Distribution** - Where specific texts appear
- **Historical People - Activity Locations** - Where people worked/lived
- **Languages - Geographic Distribution** - Map language usage
- **Script Types - Production Centers** - Where script types originated

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can I see multiple views at once?**  
A: Not currently. Switch between views using the dropdown. (Split view planned for future)

**Q: Why do some manuscripts appear in both production and holding maps?**  
A: They're the same manuscripts, just shown at different locations (where made vs where kept).

**Q: Can I filter the map by entity-level filters?**  
A: Map views are independent of entity selection. They show ALL relevant data. Use time filter to narrow results.

**Q: Why don't all scribes appear on the map?**  
A: Scribes only appear if (1) they're linked to manuscripts, and (2) those manuscripts have location data.

**Q: Can I see where a specific manuscript traveled?**  
A: Use "Manuscripts - Production Location" with Connection Lines enabled. Each line shows production ‚Üí current holding.

**Q: What's the difference between "Production Units - All" vs "By Monastery"?**  
A: "All" shows each PU at its specific location. "By Monastery" groups all PUs by their monastery, showing one marker per monastery with PU count.
