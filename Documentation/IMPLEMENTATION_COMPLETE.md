### 3. ‚úÖ Export for Network Analysis Tools

**Location**: Export buttons in the Path Finding dialog

**Formats Supported**:

#### Gephi Export
Downloads **2 CSV files**:
1. `gephi_nodes_[source]_to_[target].csv` - Node list with IDs, labels, and types
2. `gephi_edges_[source]_to_[target].csv` - Edge list with source, target, relationship type, and weight

**Import into Gephi**:
1. Open Gephi
2. Data Laboratory ‚Üí Import Spreadsheet
3. Import nodes CSV first, then edges CSV
4. Run layout algorithms (ForceAtlas2 recommended)
5. Apply styling based on "Type" attribute

#### R/igraph Export
Downloads **2 files**:
1. `r_paths_[source]_to_[target].csv` - Edge list with full metadata
2. `r_analysis_[source]_to_[target].R` - Ready-to-run R script template

**R Script Includes**:
- Data loading with igraph
- Graph creation
- Basic statistics (node count, edge count, path count)
- Visualization code
- Export templates for further analysis

**How to Use in R**:
```r
# Make sure files are in same directory
source("r_analysis_su_to_ms.R")

# The script will:
# - Load the CSV data
# - Create an igraph object
# - Print statistics
# - Generate a visualization
# - Provide export templates
```

## User Interface Changes

### New UI Elements

1. **Network Tab**

   - Hidden: Never (available for all entity types)
   - Contains: Depth control, Refresh button, SVG canvas

2. **Path Finding Dialog**

## Performance Considerations

### Network Diagram
- **Efficient for**: Networks up to ~200 nodes
- **Recommended depth**: 2 (default)
  - Depth 1: Shows immediate connections only
  - Depth 2: Shows connections and their connections (good balance)
  - Depth 3: May create dense networks (use for records with few connections)

### Path Finding
- **Algorithm**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) with visited set
- **Time complexity**: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Max depth recommended**: 4 (default)
  - Depth 1-2: Quick, finds direct connections
  - Depth 3-4: Thorough, finds indirect paths
  - Depth 5: Comprehensive but slower

### Data Indexing
- **6,110 relationship records** indexed bidirectionally on load
- **O(1) lookup** for relationships by source or target ID
- **Total load time**: ~2-3 seconds (includes all entity types + relationships)

## Research Workflows Enabled

### Workflow 1: Explore Scribe Networks
1. Select a Historical Person (scribe)
2. View Network tab ‚Üí See all manuscripts they worked on
3. Identify co-scribes (people connected to same manuscripts)
4. Click nodes to explore individual contributions

### Workflow 2: Trace Text Transmission
1. Select a Text
2. Find Connection to a Monastery
3. Discover intermediate manuscripts and production units
4. Export paths for R to analyze transmission patterns

### Workflow 3: Institutional Analysis
1. Select a Monastic Institution
2. View Network tab at depth 3
3. See all connected people, manuscripts, and texts
4. Export for Gephi to visualize community structure

### Workflow 4: Production Pattern Analysis
1. Select multiple Production Units (use filters)
2. For each, Find Connection to specific monastery
3. Compare path lengths and intermediate nodes
4. Export all paths to R for statistical analysis

## Next Steps: Advanced Queries (Phase 3)

### What's Still To Do

The advanced cross-record query system for language analysis and production patterns:

1. **Query Builder Framework**
   - Visual interface for building complex queries
   - Support for field comparisons across relationships
   - Examples: "scribal units where text language ‚â† colophon language"

2. **Relationship-Based Filters**
   - Filter by related record properties
   - "Manuscripts produced at monasteries"
   - "Scribes who worked in multiple languages"

3. **Saved Query Templates**
   - Pre-built queries for common research questions
   - Language mismatch patterns
   - High-certainty attributions
   - Multilingual production contexts

4. **Advanced Search UI**
   - Separate "Advanced Search" page or collapsible panel
   - Query history and favorites
   - Result export and sharing

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 12-16 hours

**Priority**: High for research workflows

Would you like me to start implementing the advanced query system next?
