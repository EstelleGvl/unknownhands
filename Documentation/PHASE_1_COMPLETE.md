2. **Click the Map tab** in the visualization area
3. **Explore the new features**:
   - Clustering is ON by default - click clusters to expand
   - Enable Connection Lines to see manuscript movement
   - Enable Heatmap to see density patterns
   - Adjust time sliders to filter by century
   - Enable Routes to trace manuscript journeys

### For Researchers

**Question: Where were manuscripts produced in the 13th century?**
```
1. Set time sliders to 1200-1300
2. Enable Heatmap
3. Look for red/yellow hotspots
4. Zoom in to see specific cities
```

**Question: How did manuscripts move from production to preservation?**
```
1. Select Manuscripts entity
2. Enable Connection Lines
3. Enable Routes
4. Click lines to see individual manuscript paths
```

**Question: How did geographic distribution change over time?**
```
1. Enable Heatmap
2. Set time to early period (e.g., 900-1000)
3. Note patterns
4. Adjust to later period (e.g., 1400-1500)
