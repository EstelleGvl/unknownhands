## 1. Getting Started

### What is Unknown Hands?

Unknown Hands is a digital research platform documenting the work of female scribes who created manuscripts before 1600. Our database includes:

- **Manuscripts** â€” Codices written by or associated with women
- **Production Units** â€” Information about when and where manuscripts were made
- **Scribal Units** â€” Details about the scribes themselves
- **Institutions** â€” Libraries and archives holding these manuscripts
- **Texts, People, and more** â€” Comprehensive relational data

### Navigating the Site

**Main Navigation Bar** (top of page):
- **About** â€” Learn about the project
- **Explore Database** â€” Interactive data explorer (this guide's focus)
- **Viewer** â€” View manuscript images with transcriptions
- **Search Transcriptions** â€” Full-text search across all transcribed manuscripts
- **Team, Publications, Participate** â€” Project information

### Understanding Record Types

The database contains **7 types of records**:

1. **Scribal Units (SU)** â€” The core production unit: a scribe working on a specific manuscript section
2. **Manuscripts (MS)** â€” Physical codices (books)
3. **Production Units (PU)** â€” Manufacturing contexts (where/when/how manuscripts were made)
4. **Holding Institutions (HI)** â€” Current location (libraries, archives)
5. **Monastic Institutions (MI)** â€” Historical production locations (monasteries, convents)
6. **Historical People (HP)** â€” Scribes, patrons, owners
7. **Texts (TX)** â€” Literary works contained in manuscripts

   - How many records have female vs. male vs. unknown gender
   - Overall statistics

2. **Gender vs. Geography**
   - Where were female scribes active?

- **Heatmaps** â€” Cross-tabulations (e.g., gender Ã— region)

**Important Note:**
- Gender attributions based on historical evidence
- Certainty levels indicated when available
- "Unknown" = insufficient evidence

---

### 6.3 Codicological Analysis (NEW)

**Purpose:** Analyze physical manuscript features

**6 Analysis Types:**

#### 1. Material vs. Size
- Compare manuscript dimensions for parchment, paper, and mixed materials
- See geographic and temporal patterns
- **Question:** Were parchment MSS larger than paper MSS?

**How to Use:**
1. Select "Material vs Size"
2. Choose visualization:
   - **Stats** â€” Average sizes by material
   - **Box Plot** â€” Size distributions
   - **Scatter Plot** â€” Size vs. material (colored by century)
   - **Bar Chart** â€” Mean sizes
3. View geographic breakdown table (in Stats view)

#### 2. Size vs. Date
- Track manuscript size changes over time
- Grouped by century
- See if manuscripts got larger or smaller

**How to Use:**
1. Select "Size vs Date"
2. Choose visualization
3. See century patterns
4. Geographic filters affect results

**Question to explore:** Did manuscript sizes increase in the 15th century?

#### 3. Quire Patterns
- Analyze catchwords and signatures (quire markers)
- Correlate with size, date, material, geography

**What are catchwords/signatures?**
- Catchwords: First words of next page written at bottom
- Signatures: Letters/numbers marking quire order
- Both help binders assemble manuscripts correctly

**How to Use:**
1. Select "Quire Patterns"
2. Compare MSS with vs. without catchwords
3. See size differences
4. View temporal/geographic patterns

#### 4. Column Patterns
- Number of columns vs. manuscript features
- Single vs. multi-column layouts

**How to Use:**
1. Select "Column Patterns"
2. Analyze columns vs:
   - Size (larger MSS more columns?)
   - Date (column trends over time)
   - Material
   - Geography

#### 5. Margin Ratio
- **NEW CALCULATION:** Compares manuscript size to writing area
- Formula: (Codex size - Text block size) / Codex size Ã— 100%
- Higher % = more margin space
- Size = height + width (sum of dimensions)

**What it shows:**
- How much space was left for margins
- Ratio of written vs. unwritten area
- Variation by material, date, location

**How to Use:**
1. Select "Margin Ratio"
2. View statistics (mean, median, range)
3. Compare by material or century
4. Scatter plots show correlations

**Interpretation:**
- High ratio (e.g., 40%) = large margins (luxury MSS?)
- Low ratio (e.g., 10%) = text filled page (utilitarian?)

#### 6. Custom Analysis
- Choose your own variables for X and Y axes
- Explore relationships not covered by preset analyses
- Advanced users can create custom queries

**How to Use:**
1. Select "Custom Multi-Variable Analysis"
2. Choose X-axis variable (dropdown)
3. Choose Y-axis variable (dropdown)
4. Select visualization type
5. Run analysis

**Variables include:**
- Size, height, width
- Material, date, country
- Columns, folios
- Text block dimensions
- And more...

### General Analytics Tips

**For All Analyses:**

1. **Read the data points count** â€” Shows how many records have the needed data
2. **Try different visualizations** â€” Each shows different aspects
3. **Use filters** â€” Narrow to specific time periods or regions
4. **Export results** â€” Some analyses allow CSV export
5. **Cross-reference** â€” Compare multiple analyses to find patterns

**Understanding Visualizations:**

**Stats Tables:**
- Mean = average
- Median = middle value
- Min/Max = range
- N = count of records

**Box Plots:**
- Box = middle 50% of values (Q1 to Q3)
- Line in box = median
- Whiskers = min/max (excluding outliers)
- Good for comparing distributions

**Scatter Plots:**
- Each dot = one record
- Position = X and Y values
- Color = third variable (e.g., century)
- Look for clusters, trends, outliers

**Heatmaps:**
- Color intensity = frequency or value
- Darker = more records or higher value
- Good for cross-tabulations

## 10. Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is the data complete?**
A: The database is continuously growing. We're adding manuscripts and transcriptions regularly. Current counts shown on homepage.

**Q: Can I download the entire database?**
A: Yes, in Browse mode, with no filters, click "Export CSV" to download all records of current entity type. Repeat for each type.

**Q: How do I cite the Unknown Hands database?**
A: See the "Credits" page for citation information.

**Q: Who created the data?**
A: Project team led by Estelle GuÃ©ville. Data sourced from Heurist database, incorporating research from multiple scholars. See "Team" page.

### Data Questions

**Q: What does "â€”" mean in a field?**
A: Data not available or not applicable for that record.

**Q: Why do some manuscripts not have images?**
A: Not all manuscripts have been digitized. We link to IIIF manifests when available. Check "Digitization Status" field.

**Q: What is a "Production Unit"?**
A: A PU represents the context of manuscript creation: where, when, by whom, with what materials. One MS can have multiple PUs if created in stages.

**Q: What is a "Scribal Unit"?**
A: An SU is the work of one scribe on a specific portion of a manuscript. Represents the core evidence of scribal activity.

**Q: How are dates formatted?**
A: Dates use terminus post quem (earliest possible) and terminus ante quem (latest possible). Many manuscripts can only be dated to a range (e.g., 1300-1350).

**Q: What does "normalized" mean?**
A: Normalized fields have standardized values for analysis. Example: "Normalized script" uses controlled vocabulary, while original descriptions may vary.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which browsers are supported?**
A: Modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. Latest versions recommended.

**Q: Why is the map/timeline loading slowly?**
A: Large datasets take time. Try filtering to a subset first. Clear browser cache if persistent.

**Q: Can I use the data in my research?**
A: Yes! Data is open access. Please cite appropriately. See license information on Credits page.

**Q: How do I report an error?**
A: Use GitHub issues (link in footer) or contact project team (see Contact page).

**Q: Is there an API?**
A: Currently, data is available via CSV export and JSON files. We're exploring API options for future releases.

### Feature Questions

**Q: Can I save my analyses?**
A: Currently, you can export results as CSV. Saved analysis workspaces are planned for future release.

**Q: Can I upload my own manuscripts?**
A: Not directly through the website. Contact the team if you have data to contribute.

**Q: Will there be more analysis types?**
A: Yes! We're continuously developing new analytical tools based on user feedback.

**Q: Can I compare two manuscripts side-by-side?**
A: In the Viewer, use split-screen mode. In Analytics, filter to your manuscripts and compare statistics.
