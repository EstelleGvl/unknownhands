Unknown Hands is a research project that identifies, documents, and visualizes the work of female scribes in Christian Europe before 1600. It brings together codicology, paleography, and digital humanities to collate evidence that has long been scattered or overlooked. The result is a growing, open resource for researchers, librarians, and the wider public.

# Why this project?

Women’s contributions to manuscript culture are substantially undercounted. Names are missing; attributions are uneven; multilingual work is often invisible in catalogues. Unknown Hands addresses this gap by:
  - consolidating evidence across libraries, regions, and languages;
  - modeling uncertainty explicitly rather than smoothing it away;
  - publishing a searchable dataset and visualizations that make patterns legible at scale.

# Scope
  - **Geography & period:** Christian Europe, pre-1600 (monastic and lay contexts).
  - **Materials:** Manuscripts and fragments; documentary items when they witness scribal labor.
  - **Inclusions:** Named female scribes; anonymous hands plausibly attributable to women; collaborative production where women’s roles can be argued from evidence.
  - **Exclusions:** Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac and other non-Western European languages for now (by design, due to language coverage and project scale); printed books except where directly tied to manuscript copying practices.

# Evidence and uncertainty

We encode the strength of evidence for each attribution so users can filter and interpret responsibly:
  - High - explicit colophon/signature or converging documentary proof.
  -	Medium - strong palaeographical/prosopographical argument; partial documentary support.
  - Low - suggestive but incomplete indicators (context, paratexts, institutional practice).

Uncertain fields (dates, places, identifications) carry text qualifiers and ranges to account for uncertainty.

# Multilingualism

Many women worked across Latin and vernaculars or multiple dialects. We record:
  - languages at different descriptive levels;
  -	known/likely dialects or script habits;
  -	translation or adaptation roles when identifiable.

This enables analysis of literacy, training, and audience beyond a single language label.

# Data sources & curation

Data are compiled from catalogues, archival descriptions, published scholarship, institutional records, and first-hand examination where possible. Each claim includes:
  -	citation(s) and, where feasible, page/folio references;
  -	provenance of the data (who asserted it, when);
  -	notes on dissenting views or alternative readings.

We welcome corrections and additions from librarians, scholars, and communities of practice.

# What’s available now
  -	A beta site with project overview and early exempla.
  -	A growing dataset of female scribes and their production.
  -	Initial summary visualizations (counts over time, maps, etc.).

Roadmap milestones and release notes are on the [Roadmap](/roadmap) page.
