This project is currently developed and maintained by Estelle Guéville (PhD Candidate, Yale University) with the advice and support of colleagues and mentors in manuscript studies and digital humanities.

# Project Director: Estelle Guéville, Yale University
Estelle Guéville is the founder and director of Unknown Hands. Her doctoral research focuses on female scribes in Christian Europe before 1600, with a particular interest in multilingualism, codicology, and the use of digital methods for manuscript studies. She has developed the first large-scale dataset of manuscripts copied by women and is building a digital infrastructure to make these contributions accessible to scholars and the public.
