# Project Director
**Estelle Guéville, Yale University**. 

[Estelle Guéville](https://estellegueville.com) is the founder and director of Unknown Hands. Her doctoral research focuses on female scribes in Christian Europe before 1600, with a particular interest in multilingualism, codicology, and the use of digital methods for manuscript studies.
