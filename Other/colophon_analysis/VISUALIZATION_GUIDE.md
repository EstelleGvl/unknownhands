## Overview
This guide explains the 5 visualizations created from colophon formula analysis of 604 manuscripts produced by women scribes (8th-16th centuries).

---

## Visualization 1: Temporal Distribution
**File**: `temporal_distribution.png`

### Description
Bar chart showing number of colophons by century (8th-16th).

### Key Findings
- **15th century dominance**: 341 colophons (56.5% of total)
- **16th century**: 160 colophons (26.5%)
- **Combined 15th-16th**: 501 colophons (83% of total)
- **Earlier centuries sparse**: 8th-14th centuries = 72 colophons (12%)

### Interpretation
The massive concentration in 15th-16th centuries reflects:
1. **Survival bias** - Later manuscripts preserved better
2. **Devotio Moderna** - Movement peaked 15th century, emphasized manuscript copying
3. **Literacy expansion** - More women's religious houses founded in late medieval period
4. **Vernacular turn** - Women's houses produced devotional literature for lay readers

### Comparison to Reynhout (2001)
Reynhout's sample was more evenly distributed across centuries. Women's manuscripts show:
- **Delayed adoption** - Most formulas appear 1-2 centuries after Reynhout's predicted emergence
- **Late medieval concentration** - Reflects growth of women's scriptoria in 14th-16th centuries

## Visualization 2: Geographic Distribution
**File**: `geographic_distribution.png`

### Description
Horizontal bar chart showing top 12 countries by colophon count.

### Key Findings
| Rank | Country | Count | % of Total |
|------|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Germany | 184 | 35.3% |
| 2 | Netherlands | 76 | 14.6% |
| 3 | Italy | 74 | 14.2% |
| 4 | Belgium | 70 | 13.4% |
| 5 | France | 36 | 6.9% |
| 6 | Austria | 26 | 5.0% |

### Interpretation
- **Germany dominates** - 184 colophons (35.3%), reflecting strong Dominican/Benedictine women's communities
- **Low Countries cluster** - Netherlands (76) + Belgium (70) = 146 (28%), reflecting Devotio Moderna centers
- **Italy significant** - 74 colophons (14.2%), reflecting Bridgettine houses (Santa Brigida del Paradiso, Florence)

### Comparison to Reynhout (2001)
Reynhout's geographic categories (Italian/Germanic/French/English) assumed regional scribal traditions. Women's manuscripts show **cross-geographic formula usage**, suggesting:
- **Monastic order networks** > regional workshops
- **Exemplar copying** - preserving formulas from source manuscripts regardless of origin

## Visualization 3: Formula Frequencies
**File**: `formula_frequencies.png`

### Description
Horizontal bar chart showing frequency of all 11 scholarly formulas (Reynhout 2001), color-coded by category.

### Key Findings

#### Top 5 Formulas
| Rank | Formula | Category | Count | % of MSS |
|------|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Feliciter** | Renaissance | 372 | 61.7% |
| 2 | **Transcriptus** | Renaissance | 245 | 40.6% |
| 3 | **Finitus et completus** | Low Countries/German | 189 | 31.3% |
| 4 | **Finis adest operis...** | Germanic | 185 | 30.7% |
| 5 | **Nomen scriptoris...** | Anglo-Norman | 184 | 30.5% |

#### Category Totals
- **Renaissance**: 617 total occurrences (across 2 formulas)
- **Low Countries/German**: 303 (across 2 formulas)
- **Italian**: 374 (across 3 formulas)
- **French-influenced**: 309 (across 3 formulas)

### Interpretation

1. **Renaissance formulas dominate** - "Feliciter" appears in 61.7% of manuscripts, suggesting:
   - Women's scriptoria engaged with humanist culture
   - NOT conservative/traditional-only environments
   - Active participation in 15th-century cultural movements

2. **Low Countries formulas prominent** - Reflects Devotio Moderna influence (Diepenveen, Windesheim)

3. **ALL scholarly formulas found** - 100% coverage (11/11) indicates women's scriptoria used full range of European formulaic traditions

4. **Frequency inversion** - Renaissance formulas (15th c. emergence) MORE common than Italian "ritournelles" (12th c. emergence), suggesting delayed adoption

### Comparison to Reynhout (2001)

| Formula Type | Reynhout's Frequency | Women's MSS Frequency | Interpretation |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Renaissance | Moderate (humanist milieu) | **VERY HIGH** (61.7% "Feliciter") | Women engaged humanist culture |
| Italian ritournelles | High (12-14th c.) | Moderate (23.4% max) | Delayed adoption |
| Low Countries | Regional (Netherlands/NW Germany) | **PAN-EUROPEAN** | Devotio Moderna spread |

## Visualization 4: Geographic Mismatch - Italian Formulas
**File**: `geographic_mismatch_italian.png`

### Description
Horizontal bar chart showing where Italian formulas appear geographically. Color-coded: **Green** = Italy (expected), **Red** = Other countries (unexpected).

### Key Findings

#### Italian Formulas by Country
| Country | Count | Expected? | Explanation |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Germany** | 122 | ❌ NO | Dominican networks (St. Katharina, Nuremberg) |
| **Italy** | 108 | ✅ YES | Expected |
| France | 21 | ✅ YES (Provence) | Limited |
| Portugal | 21 | ❌ NO | Portuguese women's houses copied Italian texts |
| Switzerland | 19 | Borderline | Alpine region |

### Critical Finding
**Italian formulas appear MORE in Germany (122) than in Italy (108)**

### Interpretation

This geographic inversion contradicts Reynhout's model and reveals:

1. **Textual genre drives formula choice**  
   - German Dominican nuns copied Italian saints' lives (Catherine of Siena, Clare of Assisi)
   - Formulas came from exemplars, not from regional scribal tradition

2. **Monastic order networks > Geographic proximity**  
   - Dominican order (international) > German regional workshops
   - St. Katharina, Nuremberg produced 40 colophons, many with Italian formulas

3. **Women's scriptoria = Exemplar dependency**  
   - Women copied existing manuscripts (conservative practice)
   - Preserved formulas from source texts regardless of origin
   - Male professional scriptoria innovated formulas; women conserved them

4. **Portuguese "anomaly"**  
   - 21 Italian formulas in Portugal (unexpected)
   - Convent of Jesus, Aveiro (11 colophons) copied Italian devotional texts
   - Reflects international circulation of spiritual literature

### Comparison to Reynhout (2001)

Reynhout's geographic model:
- **Italian formulas** → Italy, Provence, Languedoc, Catalonia
- **Based on**: Professional urban scriptoria (Bologna, Paris, etc.)

Women's manuscripts:
- **Italian formulas** → Germany > Italy
- **Based on**: Enclosed religious communities copying devotional texts

**CONCLUSION**: Reynhout's model works for professional/commercial scriptoria but FAILS for women's scriptoria, where **text content > geographic location**.

## Visualization 5: Institutional Patterns
**File**: `institutional_patterns.png`

### Description
Horizontal bar chart showing top 10 monasteries by colophon count.

### Key Findings

| Rank | Monastery | Location | Order | Count | % of Total |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | **St. Katharina** | Nuremberg, Germany | Dominican | 40 | 6.6% |
| 2 | **Santa Brigida del Paradiso** | Florence, Italy | Brigittine | 27 | 4.5% |
| 3 | **Notre-Dame Rose of Jericho** | Brussels, Belgium | Augustinian | 20 | 3.3% |
| 4 | **Petersfrauen** | Salzburg, Austria | Benedictine | 17 | 2.8% |
| 5 | **Vadstena Abbey** | Vadstena, Sweden | Bridgettine | 12 | 2.0% |
| 6 | **Convent of Jesus** | Aveiro, Portugal | Dominican | 11 | 1.8% |
| 7 | **Diepenveen** | Netherlands | Canons Regular | 10 | 1.7% |
| 8 | **St. Klara** | Nuremberg, Germany | Poor Clares | 10 | 1.7% |
| 9 | **San Jacopo di Ripoli** | Florence, Italy | Dominican | 10 | 1.7% |
| 10 | **St. Katharinental** | St. Gallen, Switzerland | Dominican | 8 | 1.3% |

### Interpretation

1. **Institutional concentration**  
   - Top 10 monasteries = 165 colophons (27.3% of total)
   - St. Katharina alone = 40 colophons (6.6%)
   - Suggests uneven manuscript production across women's houses

2. **Dominican dominance**  
   - 4/10 monasteries are Dominican
   - Dominican order emphasized learning, preaching → book ownership
   - Catherine of Siena (Dominican saint) → copying her works

3. **Bridgettine presence**  
   - 2/10 monasteries are Bridgettine (Santa Brigida #2, Vadstena #5)
   - Bridgettine Rule required personal liturgical book ownership
   - Explains high manuscript output

4. **Devotio Moderna representation**  
   - Diepenveen (Netherlands, #7) - Devotio Moderna center
   - Movement emphasized manuscript copying for spiritual formation

5. **Geographic diversity**  
   - Top 10 span 7 countries (Germany, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, Portugal, Netherlands, Switzerland)
   - Women's manuscript production was pan-European, not regional

### Monastic Order Analysis

| Order | Monasteries in Top 10 | Total Colophons | % |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|---|
| Dominican | 4 | 69 | 41.8% |
| Bridgettine | 2 | 39 | 23.6% |
| Augustinian | 1 | 20 | 12.1% |
| Benedictine | 1 | 17 | 10.3% |
| Poor Clares | 1 | 10 | 6.1% |
| Canons Regular | 1 | 10 | 6.1% |

**Dominican order produced 41.8% of colophons in top 10 monasteries**

### Comparison to Reynhout (2001)

Reynhout's sample:
- Primarily **male monastic** (Benedictine, Carthusian) and **professional urban** scriptoria
- Geographic clustering (Bologna, Paris, Oxford)

Women's manuscripts:
- Primarily **female enclosed communities** (Dominican, Bridgettine)
- **Order-based networks** (pan-European)
- **Institutional concentration** (few houses produce many MSS)

**CONCLUSION**: Women's manuscript production concentrated in specific houses (St. Katharina, Santa Brigida), often linked to **charismatic leadership** or **reform movements** (Devotio Moderna).

## Cross-Visualization Insights

### Insight 1: 15th Century + Germany + Renaissance Formulas = Humanist Engagement
- 15th century = 56.5% of colophons (Viz 1)
- Germany = 35.3% of colophons (Viz 2)
- "Feliciter" = 61.7% of MSS (Viz 3)

**INTERPRETATION**: German women's houses in 15th century (St. Katharina, Nuremberg) engaged with humanist culture, adopting Renaissance formulas. This challenges assumption that women's scriptoria were "conservative" or "isolated."

### Insight 2: Low Countries + Devotio Moderna + Vernacular Formulas
- Netherlands/Belgium = 28% of colophons (Viz 2)
- Low Countries formulas = 31.3% (Viz 3)
- "int jaer ons heren" (Middle Dutch) = 36 MSS (vernacular formula)

**INTERPRETATION**: Devotio Moderna centers (Diepenveen) produced vernacular devotional manuscripts with Middle Dutch dating formulas, reflecting **practical orientation** over Latin erudition.

### Insight 3: Italian Formulas Everywhere = Exemplar Copying
- Italian formulas in Germany > Italy (Viz 4)
- St. Katharina (Nuremberg) = 40 colophons, 37.5% Italian formulas (Viz 5)

**INTERPRETATION**: Women copied Italian devotional texts (Catherine of Siena), preserving formulas from exemplars. Formula choice = **content-driven**, not geography-driven.

### Insight 4: Institutional Concentration + Delayed Adoption = Charismatic Centers
- St. Katharina = 6.6% of all colophons (Viz 5)
- 15th century = 56.5% of colophons (Viz 1)
- Italian "ritournelles" peak 15th c., not 13th c. (formula analysis)

**INTERPRETATION**: Specific monasteries (St. Katharina, Santa Brigida) led manuscript production in late medieval period, adopting formulas 1-2 centuries after emergence in male scriptoria. Suggests **reform movements** or **institutional capacity** (resources, scribal training) drove production.

## Summary: Women's Colophon Practices

### CONFORMITY to Reynhout's Patterns
1. ✓ 15th century peak for Renaissance formulas
2. ✓ Some geographic alignment (Italian formulas in Italy)
3. ✓ Formula categories present (all 11/11 found)

### DIVERGENCE from Reynhout's Patterns
1. ❌ **Geographic inversion** - Italian formulas more in Germany than Italy
2. ❌ **Temporal delay** - Formulas appear 1-2 centuries late
3. ❌ **Vernacular prominence** - Middle Dutch formulas outnumber some Latin categories
4. ❌ **Institutional concentration** - Few houses (St. Katharina) produce many MSS
5. ❌ **Order networks > Regional traditions** - Dominican/Bridgettine connections matter more than proximity

### Structural Factors Explaining Divergence
1. **Monastic order affiliation** - International networks (Dominican, Bridgettine) drive formula circulation
2. **Exemplar dependency** - Copying existing MSS preserves source formulas regardless of origin
3. **Genre specificity** - Devotional texts (saints' lives, mysticism) carry genre-specific formulas
4. **Enclosed communities** - Limited external contact → delayed adoption, conservative preservation
5. **Practical orientation** - Vernacular formulas (dating, ownership) over Latin erudition

## Methodological Notes

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 604 colophons, 603 with transcription
- **Flexible matching**: Allows word order variations, abbreviations
- **Multiple dimensions**: Temporal, geographic, institutional, formulaic

### Limitations
- **Survival bias**: 83% from 15th-16th centuries
- **Database scope**: Only identified women scribes (excludes anonymous)
- **Pattern matching threshold**: 70% word-match may over-match abbreviated versions
- **Geographic anachronism**: Modern country names (not medieval political units)

### Future Research
1. **Text content analysis** - Correlate formulas with genres (hagiography vs. liturgy)
2. **Scribal hand analysis** - Do same scribes use multiple formula types?
3. **Exemplar tracing** - Identify source manuscripts from which formulas copied
4. **Comparative study** - Male monastic scriptoria (Benedictine, Carthusian) as control group
5. **Linguistic analysis** - Middle Dutch vs. Latin formula usage patterns
