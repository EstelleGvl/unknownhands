# Welcome to *Unknown Hands*!

*Unknown Hands* is the first large-scale project dedicated to uncovering, cataloguing, and visualizing the work of female scribes in Christian Europe before 1600. For centuries, the contributions of women to manuscript culture remained invisible or underestimated. This project seeks to bring them into focus.

Using archival research, codicology, paleography, and digital humanities methods, Unknown Hands compiles evidence of women‚Äôs involvement in book production: from explicitly named scribes to anonymous ‚Äúhands‚Äù identified through palaeography and contextual study. The project introduces new models for studying manuscripts and pays particular attention to uncertainty, multilingualism, and collaborative practices.

Our goals are:
	‚Ä¢	To create the first open, searchable database of manuscripts copied by women.
	‚Ä¢	To map and visualize women‚Äôs scribal activity across Europe.
	‚Ä¢	To provide resources for researchers, teachers, and the wider public.

The project is in active development. Explore our [About](/pages/about.md) page to learn more about the methods, see our [Roadmap](/pages/roadmap.md) for upcoming milestones, or visit the [Bibliography](/pages/bibliography.md) for key references on the subject of female scribes.
